1. Crete a page that displays every fetched post with its title, body text and username that posted that post.
   1. contents of each post
      1. title
      2. body text
      3. author's username
2. under every post there should be a list of comments. And these comments should have their comment posters name, email and comment body text.
   1. separate page?
   2. should we show first, like, two commments and then the rest of them under a show button
   3. oh, no, actually yeah, thats a good idea. we just show a few of the comments right away, and the rest of them are just hidden, until the _Show more_ button is pressed. Yeah, we'll do it like that.
3. Under these comments there should be an input field with a submit button, with which I could submit my own comment.
   1. Seems pretty easy, on the very bottom of each comments section we have an input box with a button next to it. Whenever the button is pressed, we add the new comment to the comments list and it should probably appear last, at the very bottom of them as well, I think.
